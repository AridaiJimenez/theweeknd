            You don't know what's in store
            But you know what you're here for

            Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
            Hold tight for this ride
            We don't need no protection
            Come alone, we don't need attention

            Open your hand, take a glass
            Don't be scared, I'm right here
            Even though, you don't roll
            Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

            Take it off, you want it off
            Cause I know what you're feeling
            It's okay, girl, I feel it too
            Let it be, baby breathe
            I swear I'm right here
            We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good

            Open your hand, take a glass
            Don't be scared, I'm right here
            Even though, you don't roll
            Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

            You wanna be high for this
            You wanna be high for this
            You wanna be high for this

            Been on another level since you came, no more pain
            You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
            You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
            But you belong to me, you belong to me

            If it hurts to breathe, open the window
            Oh, your mind wants to leave but you can't go
            This is a happy house, we're happy here
            In a happy house, oh this is fun

            Music got you lost
            Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
            Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
            This place will burn you up
            But baby it's okay, them my niggas next door
            And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
            So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home
            So don't blame it on me girl cause you wanted to have fun

            If it hurts to breathe, open the window
            Oh, your mind wants to leave but you can't go

            Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
            Whatever, together
            Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
            Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
            Then watch us chase it
            With a handful of pills, no chasers
            Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
            And she bad and her head bad
            Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
            And it's half-past six
            Read skies cause time don't exist
            But when the stars shine back to the crib
            Superstar lines back at the crib
            And we can test out the tables
            Got some brand new tables
            All glass and it's four feet wide
            But it's a must to get us ten feet high
            She give me sex in a handbag
            I get her wetter than a wet nap
            And no closed doors
            So I listen to her moans echo
            I heard he do drugs now
            You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
            We just never act a fool
            That's just how we fuckin' live it
            And when we act a fool
            It's probably cause we mixed it
            Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
            Them white boys know the deal
            Ain't no fuckin' phony
            Big O know the deal
            He the one who showed me
            Watch me ride this fucking beat
            Like he fuckin' told me
            "Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
            "She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
            I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
            Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
            Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
            If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
            But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
            And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

            La la la la la la la la
            I'm so gone, so gone

            I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
(Listen, listen)

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Aliz√© with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray that I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'mma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find baseheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign

Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

            I left my girl back home, I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass, look at all this cash
And I've emptied out my cards too
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love, baby, I can bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I can bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups, baby, I can bring the drink
Bring your body, baby, I can bring you fame
That's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma, I'll give you all I got
Give me all for this, I need confidence in myself
Listen ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself
Oh, oh, oh, woah

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight, only for tonight
Even though you don't love me
Oh, oh
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you all of me, I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance, I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
Get you dancing with the devil
Take a shot of this, but I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell, baby
So, put down your perfume

Bring your love, baby, I can bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I can bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups, baby, I can bring the drink
Bring your body, baby, I can bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
So let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma, I'll give you all I got
Give me all for this, I need confidence in myself
Listen ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself
I need all of it

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight, only for tonight
Even though you don't love me
Oh, oh
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you all of me, I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me

[II. The After Party]

[The Weeknd]
I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' rolled, but I fuckin' pulled
Feelin' like a billion bucks before
I walked through the store
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your lovin'
I need more
I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that un-con-ditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sippin' on this, baby livin' off bliss
Got me drownin' in your love
Got me drownin' in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drownin' from my wrist

Baby, if you knew
The feelin' I would give to you
You
Cause I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me
You
Oh I got it girl
With me

I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stoppin'
So, momma please stop callin'
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fuckin' prove
This feelin' I would give to you

You
Oh I got it girl
Yea, I got it girl
With me

            They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em
Is I'm livin' for the present
And the future don't exist
So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby (please, baby)
Blue-ball queen, take your fuckin' seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man (next man)
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day)
I think you lost your morals, girl (what?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rolling through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fucking 20, girl
Amnesia
Put your mind in a dream world
What you doing in the bathroom?
I hear noises in the bathroom
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em
The only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have 20 different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, motherfucker, I'm raw
My love so lost in my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got
If they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step
Man, I got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Till the ending of our credits
Life's such a movie
Filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you're inside it
You excited?

What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?
Yeah
Oh, what you thinkin' about
Oh, what you thinkin' about
What you thinkin' about
What you thinkin' about
What you thinkin'
I been thinkin' about
Hoo, hoo

I know everything
I know everything
I know it all
I know it all, oh oh

Hoo
Hoo oh
Oh oh
Ooh

            I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
I swear it's okay

'Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything

Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
Tried to keep you out
And you are done
But baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did, hey
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
Baby it's okay
It's okay

I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
